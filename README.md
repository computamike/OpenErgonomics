# OpenErgonomics
A project for setting up your work environment for optimal comfort.

# How it works 
This site is a combination of [GitHub Pages](http://computamike.github.io/OpenErgonomics/) and also 'code' - in so much as there is a compilation process.

A SVG wallpaper is rendered and packaged.  Using the GitHub Releases API, this package is then attached to the release.

Releases are made against the master branch, whereas documents are compiled automatically by github pages support.
