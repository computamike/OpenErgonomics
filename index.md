### Move desk often? 
I used to work in an office where staff members would move desks - typically to join a team working on a project for a period of time, and them move on.  Existance in that environment was nomadic, and what I needed was a way of setting up my desk automatically.

### Heads up  
The main thing I needed was a way to ensure that no matter where I went I had the latest and easiest way of setting up my computer. Your eye line should be at 70% of the height of your monitor, so what I have done is created a selection of wallpapers for different sized screens.  Therse wallpapers are based on a SVG graphic which is also included.  

In combination with all of this are a set of ergonomic set up guides that can be used to set up any computer to minimise the risk of RSI
